CPAN-Mini-Inject-Server

This module is a simple Restish webservice that makes the basic functionality
and interface of mcpani (of the CPAN::Mini::Inject package) available from
accross a network allowing for remote management of a cpan mirror.

The original envisaged use for this module was for a continuous integration
platform with distributed build nodes to be able to commit its build artifacts
back to a common CPAN repository so that subsequent builds of other modules
could use source the new version of the software.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

After the libraries are installed the service must be set up on some form of web
server.

You can use a test server (set up in cmis_test_server.pl)

    use CGI::Application::Dispatch::Server;
    my $server = CGI::Application::Dispatch::Server->new(
        class => 'CPAN::Mini::Inject::Server::Dispatch',
        port => '9000'
    );

    $server->run;

Or plain CGI can be used

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use FindBin '$Bin';
    use lib "$Bin/../../rel/path/to/my/perllib";
    use CPAN::Mini::Inject::Server::Dispatch
    CPAN::Mini::Inject::Server::Dispatch->dispatch();

Or preferably Apache and mod_perl

    <location /app>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler CPAN::Mini::Inject::Server::Dispatch
    </location>
